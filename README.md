# Budget-Templet
About:

This tool can be used to forecast spending through the year. You can use it to monitor your monthly activity and ensure that you don't exceed your budget spending. One tool I first started using is “Mint: Personal Finance &amp; Money” but I don't find it great for planning, it’s better for tracking your spending.

Templet Explination: 

Tabs
Income (Main Page)

This is the main tab, and it will showcase your monthly earnings for the year. This tab contains a bunch of formulas so there is no need to input any value; it will be done automatically based on the next few tabs, I will explain that later.  This tab also includes a graph to show the relationship of earning by month, quarters, and years. 

Year Tab: 
The year tab is where the data is imputed. There are two tables per month in each year. The green table labeled with the month and year is where the earnings are imputed. It will take the sum for the whole month, and that data will be pasted to the main page in it’s respected month. This will also trigger the graph to adjust to show the earning for that month, and the earning of the year so far.
The next table is the expense. There are different categories. Feel free to change the name for the category to anything you want.
