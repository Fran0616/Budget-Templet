# Budget-Templet
This tool can be used to forecast spending through the year. You can use it to monitor your monthly activity and ensure that you don't exceed your budget spending. One tool I first started using is “Mint: Personal Finance &amp; Money” but I don't find it great for planning, it’s better for tracking your spending.
